        Foods with a high complex carbohydrate content, such as whole-wheat
        pasta, sweet potatoes, and brown rice are good sources of energy for
        swimmers. A diet of carbohydrates that release their energy gradually
        keeps your energy level constant so you can swim longer. However, they
        are not digested that fast.

                  If you are a swimmer, carbohydrates are your best ally— and
                  you should eliminate the idea that they are bad for you. Not
                  all carbohydrates are equal, though, and some should be
                  avoided. Oatmeal, however? It’s one of the healthiest sources
                  of carbohydrates out there. According to the Journal of Food
                  Science and Technology, oats are also high in protein, roughly
                  11-15%.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Bananas are tasteful and a great form of carbohydrates,
                  potassium, and vitamins B6 and C. One large banana (136 grams)
                  contains 121 calories and 31 grams of carbohydrates. Bananas
                  can also assist with hydration (a banana is 75% water). That
                  said, you should still consume plenty of water before, during,
                  and after swimming. This makes them a perfect pre- or
                  post-workout snack and an easy way to get in extra calories
                  throughout the day. Bananas are commonly believed to help with
                  cramps.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Milk is high in carbohydrates and protein, with 1 cup
                  (approximately 250ml) containing 12 grams of carbohydrates and
                  8 grams of protein. This makes it a perfect post-workout food
                  for swimmers. Why exactly? Well, carbohydrates and proteins
                  consumed together are more efficient at repairing muscle than
                  consuming them separately. If you want to switch up the taste,
                  low-fat chocolate milk is also a great option.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Eggs are a staple in many top athletes’ diets, and it’s easy
                  to see why- they are cheap, can be cooked in many ways- and
                  most importantly, pack about 6 grams of protein per large egg.
                  Eggs also contain all eight essential amino acids needed to
                  build and maintain muscle. You can prepare your eggs in many
                  ways- scrambled, omelet, poached, boiled, and more. They also
                  go well with many other foods. Tip: Quickly prepare 1 or 2
                  boiled eggs before training and enjoy with some salt as part
                  of your post-workout snack.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Oranges are one of my favorite citrus fruits— and I’m sure
                  many will agree they are delicious. Raw oranges pack about 47
                  calories and 12 grams of carbohydrates per 100 grams. They are
                  also rich in vitamin C, potassium, and antioxidants. Vitamin C
                  plays a vital role in immune function and keeping you healthy.
                  Swimmers can also try out orange juice. It’s similar in
                  nutritional value but will be easier to consume in large
                  quantities if you are looking for some extra calories. That’s
                  because orange juice is lower in fiber and is in liquid form.
                  Research has also shown that vitamin C, as found in oranges,
                  may improve iron absorption from other foods you eat.
